        <h1>What is Nuna?</h1>
        <p>Nuna is an Inuktitut word that roughly translates to “land.” But for the Inuit people of Northern Canada and Alaska region, Nuna also includes the Atlantic Ocean, the islands along the icy coastline, the mainland, and the peninsula between the fjords. Knowledge of Nuna has helped locals and incomers navigate the vast glacial landscape, transforming an otherwise hellish place into an enriching Greenlandic culture. The Inuit built intricate wooden maps of their peculiar landscape long ago. Nuna, the web application, leverages modern mapping technologies for users around the world to tell their stories of enduring, persisting, and loving the places that make them feel at home.</p>
